What is JavaScript?

JavaScript is a programming language that makes websites interactive!
Think of it like this:
- HTML = the skeleton (structure)
- CSS = the skin and clothes (styling)
- JavaScript = the muscles and brain (behavior and interaction)

JavaScript can:
- Respond to button clicks
- Change text and images on the page
- Create animations
- Handle forms
- And much more!

Let's start with the most basic thing - showing a message to the user.

// This line shows a popup message to the user:
alert("Hello Prince! Welcome to JavaScript!");

// This line writes something to the browser's console:
console.log("This message appears in the developer tools!");
